These instructions briefly recap the content you went through in the tutorial. This document is editable, so you should edit and improve the instructions below to help other mappers.

You and your team members will be working actual Twitter reports from Typhoon Pablo (also known as Bopha), which hit the Phillippines in December 2012. Your team must figure out which reports describe relevant crisis events, and record them with the type of event, its description, and its location. By effectively solving this problem and creating an accurate crisis map with your teammates, you can help us learn how to better respond to future natural disasters.
