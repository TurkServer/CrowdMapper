<!-- The project -->

<template name="tut_project">
    <p>In this project, you will work with a team of other crisis mappers to create a crisis map for Typhoon Pablo, a Category 5 hurricane which hit the Philippines in December 2012.</p>

<!-- Final reminders -->

<!-- Ground rules - EXPERIMENT ONLY -->

<template name="tut_groundrules">
    <p>The project will run for one hour.

    <p>You may quit the project at any time.

    <p>If you perform no activity for XX mins, you will be automatically paused.

<!-- Payment -->

<template name="tut_payment">
    <p>Your payment will be determined by how much time you personally spend working on the task, and also the overall performance of your team

    <p>Your team will be competing with other teams, and your team's performance will be assessed relative to the best-performing team.

    <p><b>Your compensation will be calculated as: (Minutes You Worked)/60 * [$6 + team_bonus]</b>

    <p>Your team bonus will be calculated as: (Number of Valid Events Your Group Correctly Labels)/(Highest Number of Valid Events Labeled By Any team)

    <p><b>If you work for the full one hour, your compensation will be no less than $6 and as much as $15, depending on your team's relative performance.</b>

    <p>If you quit early or pause you will only by paid for the fraction of time you work.

    <p>Thus you have an incentive both to work hard yourself and also to help your team succeed.
