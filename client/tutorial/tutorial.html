These should be recorded on the crisis map.     <p> Other reports are irrelevant or inaccurate and should not be recorded. </template><!-- Overview of page sections --><template name="tut_datastream">    <p>Data reports appear as Tweets in the Stream on the left.    <p><i>This tutorial shows example data.
