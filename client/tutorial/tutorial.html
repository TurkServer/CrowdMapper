<!-- Final reminders -->

<!-- Ground rules - EXPERIMENT ONLY -->

<template name="tut_groundrules">
    <p>The project will run for one hour.</p>

    <p>You may quit the project at any time.</p>

    <!-- <p>You may also pause your work during the project by clicking on the Pause button. You may resume at any time by clicking the Resume button.</p> -->

    <p>If you perform no activity for several minutes, your session will be automatically idled.</p>

<!-- Payment -->

<template name="tut_payment">
    <p>Your payment will be determined by how much time you personally spend working on the task, and also the overall performance of your team.</p>

    <p>Your team may be competing with other teams, and your team's performance will be measured relative to either the best-performing team or other benchmarks.</p>

    <p>Your compensation will be calculated as:</p>

    <blockquote>
    <p><b>(minutes you worked)/60 &times; ($6 + your team bonus)</b></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Your team bonus will be calculated as:</p>

    <blockquote>
    <p><b>(Valid events your team correctly records)/(Highest number of valid events labeled by any team)</b></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><b>If you work for the full one hour, your compensation will be no less than $6 and as much as $15, depending on your team's relative performance.</b></p>

    <p>If you quit early or are idle you will only by paid for the fraction of time you work. Your payment will be shown during the task in the highlighted region.</p>
