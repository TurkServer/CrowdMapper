<template name="tut_whatis">
    <p>Welcome to the Crisis Mapping Experiment, a collaboration between researchers at Microsoft Research, Facebook, Harvard University, and The Standby Task Force.</p>

    <p>We are conducting an experiment to better understand how groups of people can work together on a crisis mapping problem.</p>

    <p> A “crisis map” is created in response to a natural or humanitarian
    disaster by monitoring social media for reports of events on the ground and placing them on a map.</p> 
</template>

<template name="tut_experiment">

    <p>As a participant in this experiment, you will be shown Twitter reports from Typhoon Pablo, a Category 5 hurricane which hit the Philippines in December 2012.</p>

    <p><b>NOTE: This hurricane and the data you see is historical. This is not an actual crisis.</b></p>
</template>

<template name="tut_yourtask">
    <p>Your group must figure out which reports describe crisis events.
    You must then record these events with the following information: the
    type of event, its location, and its description.</p>

    <p>Some of these reports describe events for example, flooded regions,
        washed out roads or bridges, or local residents that have been
        displaced that should be recorded on the crisis map. </p>

    <p> Other reports are irrelevant or inaccurate and should not be recorded. </p>

    <p><b>Next, we'll briefly describe how to build a crisis map.</b></p>
</template>

<template name="tut_datastream">
    <p>Data appears in the <b>Tweet Stream</b> on the left.</p>
</template>

<template name="tut_filterdata">
    <p>You may click on any link to see what the tweet refers to.</p>
    
    <p>You may also hide tweets that appear to be irrelevant. When you hide a tweet, it disappears for everyone.</p>

    <p>One of these tweets is irrelevant.  <b class="text-error">Hide the irrelevant tweet now.</b></p>

<template name="tut_navbar">
    <p>The navbar allows you to access the three primary ways to share
    information and work with others: <b>event records</b>, <b>map</b>, and <b>documents</b>.</p>

<template name="tut_events">
    <p>The <b>Event Records</b> pane is the primary tool for recording
    events.</p>

<template name="tut_events_sources">
    <p>The <b>Sources</b> column shows all tweets that refer to the same event.</p>
</template>

<template name="tut_events_type">
    <p>Events that are relevant for crisis mapping will fit into one of
    these types: 
    <ul>
      <li>infrastructure damage: roads</li>
      <li>infrastructure damage: housing</li>
      <li>infrastructure damage: other</li>
      <li>infrastructure damage: bridges</li>

    <p>The <b>Location</b> column shows the latitude/longitude for the event.</p>

    <p>The tweet does not have information about the location. Leave it blank for now.</p>
</template>

<template name="tut_editevent">
    <p>You may also edit an existing event record by double-clicking or by clicking the
    Edit button. Only one person can edit an event record at a time, so when done,

<!-- Final reminders -->

<template name="tut_groundrules">
    <p>The experiment will run for one hour.</p>

    <p>At the end of the experiment, your group will be graded on the completeness and correctness of your crisis map. </p>

    <p>Your payment will be determined by how much time you personally spend working on the task, and also the overall performance of your group</p>

    <p>You may quit the experiment at any time, however you will only by paid for the time you work</p>

    <p>You may also pause your work during the experiment by clicking on the Pause button. You will not be paid for the time when you are paused but may re-enter the experiment at any time by clicking the Restart button.<p>

    <p>If you perform no activity for XX mins, you will be automatically paused.<p>
