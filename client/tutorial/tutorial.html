<template name="tut_whatis">
    <p>Welcome to the Crisis Mapping Experiment, a collaboration between researchers at Microsoft Research, Facebook, Harvard University, and The Standby Task Force.</p>

    <p>For the best experience, please maximize the window containing this task or make it as large as possible.</p>

    <p>We are conducting an experiment to better understand how groups of people can work together on a crisis mapping problem.</p>

    <p> A “crisis map” is created in response to a natural or humanitarian
    disaster by monitoring social media for reports of events on the ground and placing them on a map.</p> 
</template>

<template name="tut_experiment">

    <p>As a participant in this experiment, you will be shown Twitter reports from Typhoon Pablo, a Category 5 hurricane which hit the Philippines in December 2012.</p>

    <p><b>NOTE: This hurricane and the data you see is historical. This is not an actual crisis.</b></p>
</template>

<template name="tut_yourtask">
    <p>Your group must figure out which reports describe relevant crisis events.</p>

    <p>You must then record these events describing the
        type of event, its description, and its location.</p>

    <p>Relevant reports include damage to infrastructure, reports of flooded regions,
        casualties, local residents that have been
        displaced, and evacuation centers. These should be recorded on the crisis map. </p>

    <p> Other reports are irrelevant or inaccurate and should not be recorded. </p>
</template>

<!-- Overview of page sections -->

<template name="tut_datastream">
    <p>Data reports appear as Tweets in the Stream on the left.</p>
</template>

<template name="tut_filterdata">
    <p>You should click on links to see what reports refer to, and to determine whether or not the data is relevant.</p>
    
    <p>You may also hide tweets that appear to be irrelevant. When you hide a tweet, it disappears for everyone.</p>

    <p><b class="text-error">Find an irrelevant tweet and hide it.</b></p>
</template>

<template name="tut_navbar">
    <p>The navbar allows you to access the three primary ways to share
    information and work with others: <b>event records</b>, <b>map</b>, and <b>documents</b>.</p>

    <p>It also shows <b>notifications</b> you receive from other mappers.</p>
</template>

<template name="tut_events">
    <p>The <b>Event Records</b> pane is the primary tool for recording
    events.</p>
    
    <p>Here you will see all of the event records you and your collaborators create.</p>
</template>

<template name="tut_event_description">
     <p>Event records comprise several fields describing information about events.</p>

     <p>Your job is to fill in these fields for each relevant crisis event.</p>

     <p>Some information about the event can be found in the tweet itself, while other information can be found online or will require your own judgment.</p>
</template>

<template name="tut_create_event">
    <p>Create a new event by clicking this button.</p>
</template>

<template name="tut_editevent">
    <p>You may also edit an existing event record by double-clicking or by clicking the
        yellow <b>Edit</b> button. You will see edits by other mappers in real-time.</p>

    <p>Only one person can edit an event record at a time, so when done,
        click the green <b>Save</b> button that appears.</p>

    <p><b class="text-error">Click the edit button on the event record you just created.</b></p>
</template>

<template name="tut_events_index">
    <p>The first column shows records numbered in the order they were created.</p>

    <p>You can use this number to coordinate with other mappers in the chat room, which we'll show later.</p>
</template>

<template name="tut_events_sources">
    <p>The <b>Sources</b> column shows all tweets that refer to the same event.</p>

    <p>You can attach a tweet to the event record by dragging it and dropping it on the record.</p>

    <p><b class="text-error">Drag a tweet over to the event you just created.</b></p>
</template>

<template name="tut_events_type">
    <p>Events that are relevant for crisis mapping will fit into one of
    these types:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Damaged bridges</li>
    <li>Damaged crops</li>
    <li>Damaged hospitals/health facilities</li>
    <li>Damaged housing</li>
    <li>Damaged roads</li>
    <li>Damaged schools</li>
    <li>Damaged vehicles</li>

<template name="tut_events_region">
    <p>The <b>Region</b> column shows the region where the event
    occurred.</p>

    <p>The Philippines has 17 administrative regions.</p>

    <p>If you can determine the region, <b class="text-error">add the region from the tweet.</b></p>

    <!-- Add the region from the tweet. -->
</template>

<template name="tut_events_province">
    <p>The <b>Province</b> column is the province where the event
    occurred.</p>

    <p>There are 80 provinces in the Philippines.</p>

</template>

<template name="tut_events_location">
    <p>The <b>Location</b> column shows the latitude/longitude for the event.</p>

    <p>If an event record does not have a location yet, you can place it on a map.</p>

    <!-- This needs to be changed --->
    <p>Press the <b>Locate</b> button to place the event on the map.</p>

    <!-- <p>The tweet does not have information about the location. Leave it blank for now.</p> -->
</template>

<template name="tut_addtweet">
    <p>You may also <b>add additional tweets to existing event records</b> if they refer to
    the same event. You can also <b>drag tweets from one event to another</b> to correct mistakes or reorganize records.</p>

    <p>By <b>hovering your mouse over a tweet</b> that has been attached to an event, you will see its content. You can also click the small X in the popover to hide the tweet.</p>

    <p>If you can find another tweet that refers to the same event as this one, add it to the record by dragging and dropping.</p>

    <!--
    <p>This tweet has additional information about the event you just
    recorded.<b class="text-error">Add this tweet to the record.</b></p>

<template name="tut_sortevent">
    <p>You can sort events by their data by clicking the chevrons in the event header.</p>
</template>

<template name="tut_map">
    <p>The <b>Map</b> displays a marker for each recorded event.</p>
    
    <p>If no latitude/longitude has been entered for an event, the marker will not appear on the map.</p>

    <!-- the marker will appear in the sidebar. -->
