<p>Welcome to the Crisis Mapping Experiment, a collaboration between researchers at Microsoft Research NYC, Stevens Institute of Technology, Harvard University, and The Standby Task Force.</p>

<h3>Crisis Mapping</h3>

<p>Crisis mapping is a relatively recent but rapidly growing phenomenon, starting with the 2010 Haiti Earthquake.</p>

<p>In response to a natural or humanitarian disaster, crisis-mappers (e.g. Standby Task Force) monitor social media and other news sources for reports of events on the ground, and then verify and geo-locate these reports. The result is an annotated “crisis map” that evolves in real-time, and which can be used by external decision makers, first responders, non-government organizations, and local residents.</p>

<h3>The Experiment</h3>

<p>We are conducting an experiment to better understand how groups of people can work together on a crisis mapping problem.</p>

<p>As a participant in this experiment, you will be shown Twitter reports from an actual crisis: Typhoon Pablo, a Category 5 hurricane which hit the Philippines in December 2012.</p>

<p>Some of these reports contain information that is relevant for a crisis map—for example, flooded regions, washed out roads or bridges, or local residents that have been displaced—while other reports are irrelevant or redundant. Likewise, some reports are accurate, reporting actual events correctly, while others contain errors or may even be fictitious.</p>

<p>Your group must figure out which reports are both relevant and accurate, and to create events with additional information, including the type of problem, its location, and any appropriate description, in our database.  These events will then appear as icons on your crisis map.</p>

<p>How you go about completing this task is up to you and your teammates.</p>

<p>At the end of the experiment, your group will be graded on the completeness and correctness of your crisis map. The experiment will run for one hour. You may quit at any time.</p>

<h3>CrowdMapper</h3>

<p>During the experiment, you will use CrowdMapper, a customized open-source platform that we have designed and built for this experiment. The platform comprises several components, with which you will need to be familiar.  The following describes each component, and how to use it, in detail.</p>

<ol style="list-style: decimal inside">
<li>The <strong>Data Stream</strong> appears on the left, and is a stream of actual tweets that will be shown to all participants. You may click links in a tweet to investigate them, and hide tweets that appear to be irrelevant. Finally, you can attach tweets to rows on the Events page by dragging them and dropping on an event, which establishes them as a reference for the event (see below).
</li>
<li>The <strong>Map</strong> represents events that have been entered in the spreadsheet with a location. You may hover or click on any event to view its details, and drag any event marker to change its geographical location.
</li>
<li>The <strong>Events</strong> page is the primary tool for creating events from the Data Stream. You may edit any event by double-clicking or clicking the Edit button. You may edit any field by clicking on it; click Save to allow someone else to edit. The Sources field shows any tweets that have been attached to an event, and the Location field show’s an event’s location on the map, if any.
</li>
<li><strong>Documents</strong> are available for recording information relevant to the task but not included in the database, and are shared with everyone else. You start with one default document, which describes the platform and how to use it. You can rename any document by clicking on its title and create new documents as necessary.
</li>
<li><strong>Chat Rooms</strong>. You may create and join chat rooms to communicate with other users. Each chat room displays the entire history of chats in that room. You will see a list of all chat rooms and the number of people in them, but you can only be in one chat room at a time.  To leave a chat room, you can either click on “leave” or click on another chat room, which will then become active.
</li>
<li>The <strong>User List</strong> shows team members who are currently active in green, and those who have stopped participating in grey.
</li>
</ol>
